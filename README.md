This is a repository for the Data Visualization with Python Course from Cognitive Class/Coursera

I took this course on Cognitiv Class because I work at IBM and can get the badge without having to make a payment

**Please take a look at the notebook to check out notes and examples of various plots that can be useful to represent data in different scenarios. The notebook also talks about general concepts and best practices on visualizations and matplotlib as well**

This repository will be updated with more interesting visualizations and examples
